# Calculating-proportion-of-qualitatively-generated-themes
This project uses Python code to quantify the frequency of qualitatively generated overarching themes to determine how often those themes occurred in the data. It helps researchers not just report the number and title of the overarching themes, but also which theme was discussed more than others. It helps to understand what the priorities or main concerns were highlighted by the participants. 

You can use the code to quantify both one-time collected data (e.g., interviews, focus groups, open-ended survey questions) and longitudinal qualitative data.
