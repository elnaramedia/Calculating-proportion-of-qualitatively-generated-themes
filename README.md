# Calculating-proportion-of-qualitatively-generated-themes
We developed Python code to quantify the frequency of qualitatively generated overarching themes, to determine how often those themes occurred in the data. You can use the code to quantify both one-time collected data (e.g., interviews, focus groups, open-ended survey questions) and longitudinal qualitative data.
