# Calculating-proportion-of-qualitatively-generated-themes
We developed Python code to quantify the frequency of qualitatively generated overarching themes to determine how often those themes occurred in the data. It helps researchers not just report the number and title of the overarching themes, but also which theme was discussed more than others. It helps to understand what the priorities or main concerns were highlighted by the participants in your investigated topic. 

You can use the Python code to quantify both one-time collected data (e.g., interviews, focus groups, open-ended survey questions) and longitudinal qualitative data for each time unit you collected data (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, semester, yearly).

Data
The data used for this research is collected at the Polytechnic, Purdue University during Fall 2023 across ten weeks. The data is not sharable.
