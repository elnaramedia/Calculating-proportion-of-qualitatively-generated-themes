# Calculating-proportion-of-qualitatively-generated-themes
**Overview**
We developed a Python script to quantify the frequency of overarching themes identified through qualitative analysis. This tool helps researchers move beyond simply listing themes by showing how often each theme appears in the dataset. By doing so, it highlights which topics were most frequently discussed, offering insight into participants' priorities and main concerns related to the research topic.

The Python script can be used with both one-time data collections (e.g., interviews, focus groups, open-ended survey responses) and longitudinal qualitative data collected across time (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, semester, or yearly).

**Data**
The data used for this research were collected at Purdue University's Polytechnic during Fall 2023, spanning ten weeks. The data is not sharable.
